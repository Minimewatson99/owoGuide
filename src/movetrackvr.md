# MoveTrackVR

moveTrackVR utilizes uncalibrated sensor data instead of the (Game) Rotation Vector. This approach bypasses any automated calibration algorithms implemented by the phone. Many phones incorporate customized sensor algorithms, including drift correction and custom dead zones, which vary across different devices. Unfortunately, the (Game) Rotation Vector on most phones tends to be unreliable due to these customized algorithms. moveTrackVR is compatible with SlimeVR. 

moveTrackVR is less known, but is the 2nd option if owoTrack doesn't find your sensors.

moveTrackVR is only available for Android, and can be downloaded from the [Github](https://github.com/Timocop/moveTrackVR/tree/v9.7.6)
