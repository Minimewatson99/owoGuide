# About owoTrack

```admonish warning
owoTrack is mostly a proof of concept. Using phones for trackers does not lead to the best results, and fixing bad tracking quality is not always possible.
```
```admonish danger
Strapping phones (or tablets) to your body can damage or break the devices, which can lead to you getting covered in broken glass. Take caution when strapping devices to you!
```

owoTrack is an app for Android, iOS, and WearOS that allows you to use your phone, tablet, or smartwatch as a SlimeVR tracker for use in VR or motion capture.

It is suggested to read the [Android](android/connecting.md) and [iOS](ios/connecting.md) connection guides for more info.

# Specs of phones

Some phones have better IMUs (Inertial Measurement Unit) than others. This can lead to some phones having better tracking quality than others, however it does depend on how the manufacturer has configered the phone. The IMU models used by many phones are documented on this site, but a better IMU doesn't always mean better tracking.

```admonish warning
Please do not buy phones for Full Body Tracking. They will be more expensive than buying SlimeVR Trackers, and offer worse tracking. It is reccomended to [buy](https://slimevr.dev/) or [build](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/index.html) actual SlimeVR Trackers instead.
